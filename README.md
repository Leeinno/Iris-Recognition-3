# Iris recognization using DCT & DWT as feature extraction

# Objective
In this project we aim to recognize iris using DCT and DWT as methods for feature extraction. In the past, one of the common methods to recognize iris was through KLT (Karhunen-Loeve Transform) which was computationally heavy and itâ€™s performance was not satisfactory in real time scenario. This project aims to target the same problem using
DCT/DWT, which are computationally less expensive.

# Motivation
The uniqueness of biometric patterns found in the iris of an individual makes it suitable for various applications such as device authentication, biometric key cryptography etc. Iris recognition is currently a hot topic in research and the current state of the art technology faces challenges like consistent performance under variability, low speed of enrollment and recognition etc. which makes it unreliable for real time use. Recently some smart phone manufactures have started using iris recognition system as a security feature in devices, but they are not that reliable and one has to revert to other robust methods.
